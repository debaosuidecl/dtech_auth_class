JWT
is a method that actually encrypts user details. for later retrieval when needed.



USER ARRIVES ON OUR SIGN UP PAGE

ENTERS THEIR DETAILS AND PASSWORD.

WE ENCRYPT THEIR PASSWORD
AND SAVE THEIR DETIALS AND THEIR ENCRYPTED PASSWORD TO OUR DATABASE




THEN WE encrypt their USER ID into  JWT TOKEN. and then we send that token back to the user and store it in the users local storage. 
(userid=> token)encryption

so that whenever they make a request to our website, the token is sent to our server,
 and we decrypt the token to be sure that its is meant for the user that is sending it   (token => userid) decryption

 we use the user id to find the user in our database. and if that user exists we then allow the user to access  his contents.

 {
     userid: "2f2fj3fjkdfasfd"
 }


 //sign in process

 the user enters their email and password.

 the email and password hits our server and 
 we need to find the user by the email
 we then encrypt the password entered by the user using the same bcrypt package. 
 and we make a comparison to the password of that same user in our database
 if the 2 encryptions are the same, we grant the user access

localStorage(JWT) ----- TO THE SERVER ---- WE THEN DECRYPT THE TOKEN TO BE SURE IT IS LEGIT FOR THE USER SENDING IT.
